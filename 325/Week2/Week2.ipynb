    "In modern physics one specifies a theory for a given *scale* - theories generally don't hold under arbitrary conditions (a fancy word describing exceptions to this rule is 'UV completeness' ). Classical mechanics holds when quantum fluctuations are irrelevant but we will also assume gravity is Newtonian and relativity is Galilean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us make that slightly more precise (but still very vague because this isn't a QM course): Suppose points A and B in (flat) space (and) time are connected by a straight classical trajectory. A quantum particle moving from point A and point B can be said to take all possible paths, not just the classical path. Deviations from the classical trajectory are the so-called quantum fluctuations (around the classical *least action* path). When we measure the position of the particle at some time $t$, we expect to get \n",

    "a known classical position plus some quantum fuzziness. Suppose we measure position with a probe that is sensitive to length scales $\\mu$. Then, the realm of classical physics is $\\mu \\gg |\\delta q|$: A scale where quantum fluctuations are irrelevant to the dynamics. For a numerical sense, you can replace $|\\delta q|$ with the De Broglie wavelength (among other things).\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\mu$ might be on the order of the diameter of the human pupil, for example (remember diffraction limited optics?). As biological probes of Nature, we typically observe things in the classical regime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scales will play an increasingly important role in your understanding of physics moving on. Ultimately, our field is about understanding what happens when you tweak $\\mu$ - turn the knob of the microscope or telescope, so to speak, and ask the question \"What structures emerge as you go from quarks to galaxies\"?

    "- Given an initial position, the position at a later time may be obtained *deterministically* by solving a set of second order differential equations. That is, a unique solution exists to the initial value problem describing motion. The solution uniquely parameterizes the path of least resistance/action.  \n",
    ">Not first order for obvious stability reasons: Momentum can be exchanged so at some point you'll end up having to differentiate it wrt to time to describe dynamics.  Why we don't go higher than second order is a delicate question but it *must* be asked. If there is no reason to stop at second order, we shouldn't. Turns out, there is again a (*much* more subtle) stability reason. I might teach you about Ostrogradsky instabilities of higher derivative equations of motion if we have time near the end of the semester. \n"

    "**1.1** Let's set the stage. We know that we want to describe the evolution of a point in space and time. We know that time is special in that all coordinate systems measure the same time. Then, we can imagine an $\\mathbb R^3$ attached to each point of $\\mathbb R$, the time axis. Then, the Universe is the direct product of these spaces $\\mathbb R^3\\times \\mathbb R\\cong\\mathbb R^4$. A point in this space is a vector written $(q_1,q_2,q_3;  t)$. The possible transformations of this point leave the time coordinate invariant (by our first assertion).\n",

Saying we live in $\\mathbb R^4$ is incompatible with our first assertion because it implies that there is a universal origin. Our universe is really a 4 dimensional [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space). This is a technical nuance - your intuition will probably serve you well enough.\n",

Most of the effort that goes into solving problems is choosing *correct* coordinate systems. Note that all coordinate systems on the real line are equivalent, it's a matter of naming the position variable. We will eventually move away from vector coordinates and talk about energies expressed as functions of generalized coordinates. It will turn out that the energetic approach is *much* simpler.\n",

The simplest problems you will encounter involve embedding the dynamical system in $\\mathbb R^2$ with origin chosen in a physically meaningful way (pivot of a pendulum for example) and parameterizing the motion in suitable coordinates - either polar or rectangular. This will give you two, potentially coupled, second order differential equations at most. It could be that the problem \n",
